This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The issue is that the dimensions are not always immediately available, especially on app launch or when the screen orientation changes.  Attempting to access the dimensions before they are available leads to undefined values or crashes.  For example:

```javascript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

// ... use width and height here ...
```

This code might work sometimes, but if `Dimensions.get('window')` hasn't populated yet, `width` and `height` will be `undefined`, causing errors.
